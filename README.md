# smartSense Consulting ML Assessment 2

This repository contains my code for the AI/ML Coding Assessment 2 of smartSense Consulting.

## Getting Started

- Ensure that you have Python 3.10 installed on your laptop. Run the following commands to check the versions of flutter and dart installed.
```
python --version
```

- Install the requirements.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: I have done exploraty data analysis and tried to do kmeans clustering. Haven't deployed the code yet.

## Source Code Structure

Structuring the folders is a very important first step in organizing good code. The below figure shows the general structure of the my repository.
